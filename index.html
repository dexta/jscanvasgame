        <h3>Welcome to js canvas game.</h3>
        <p>this framework should be simple, tiny and modular, one file is enough to start your first mock-up.
          Just one dependency to jQuery, do so mutch in the DOM Tree to show up your information as you can.
          Canvas can be very slow in some Browser Implemetation and cases, but have the power of geometry.

          <h2>the framework starts with the arcade game <i>Pong</i></h2>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Pong</a> is one of the earliest arcade video games; it is a tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. The Name was a hint to worlds first action electric game. In 1958, William Higinbotham created a game called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_game">Tennis for Two</a>, a competitive two-player tennis game played on an oscilloscope. The players would select the angle at which to put their racket, and pressed a button to return it. Although this game was incredibly simple, it demonstrated how an action game (rather than previous puzzles) could be played on a computer.[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_game#cite_note-Ars_Technica-2">2</a>]
        </p>

          <h3>First idea was be able to start with a basic setup.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Canvas DOM to JavaScript, get Size or define it</li>
            <li>Key Events sets and configurable</li>
            <li>Mouse Buttons Event and moves stored as Object</li>
            <li>Touch to Mouse (just one finger as yet)</li>
            <li>simple FPS counter, to prove the performance</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>use the javascript objects to store the data</h3>

<pre><code>// define the ball
var bPos = {x:50,y:50,w:10,h:10};
// define a direction object
var bDir = {x:-1,y:1};
...
function draw() {
  bPos.x += bDir.x*6;
  bPos.y += bDir.y*4;
  ...
  // test if the ball is outside the view
  if(bPos.y<0 || (bPos.y+bPos.h)>HEIGHT) {
    // if lower then 0 or greater than height -> change the direction
    bDir.y *= -1;
    }
  if(bPos.x<0 || (bPos.x+bPos.w)>WIDTH) { 
    bDir.x *= -1;
    }
}
</code></pre>
          <br />
          These lines of code draw a rectangle in the canvas, move it and test the collision with the edge.

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird">Flappy Bird</a> is a 2013 mobile game notorious for its difficulty level. It was developed in Hanoi by Vietnam-based developer Nguyễn Hà Đông[3][4] (Dong Nguyen) and published by .GEARS Studios, a small, independent game developer also based in Vietnam.[5] The game, which was released on May 24, 2013, was removed from both Apple's App Store and Google Play by its creator on February 10, 2014.
          After start to think about of an HTML5 version i <a href="http://fanboys.fm/#154">found</a> an other nice Fan Game called <a href="http://distractionware.com/blog/2014/02/maverick-bird/">Maverick Bird</a>.<br />
          <h4>And Maverick Bird shows up whats maybe needed for the framework.</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>create a default canvas object as prototype</li>
            <li>collision control functions [box,circle]</li>
            <li>game state screens in HTML, Intro, Gameover, Hiscore</li>
            <li>audio, background music and sound effects</li>
          </ol> 

          <h4>Fan Game based on Flappy Bird the Android and iOS wonder</h4>

          <h2>the past, the present and the future</h2>
          My knowledge about Canvas and JavaScript based on this Projects:<br />
          <h2>Blender Like Nodes</h2>
          Prototypeing and JSON are very important for the Language,and to solve a bunch of problemes in the Project.<br />
          Take a look to the pulling up develoment resulute.<br />

          A Side Scrolling Shooter based on my reminisce about the Commodore Plus/4 Version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_(video_game)">Scramble</a>
          <br /><br />
          A lot of performance issues and collision detection stuff.<br />

          <h2>Such Quest Helfer</h2>
          Is a tool to mark items on the a map. In the settler free online game are hidden thinks on your island. You can help a friend to find the place.
          The tool gone be obsolet, the gamedesigner added the same inside.

          <h2>Crillion - restart</h2>
          <a href="http://www.c64-wiki.de/index.php/Crillion">Crillion</a> a C64 Game i found on a Disk in the late 1980 years, in the past i tried make a Canvas version of it. If no better idea came up, this is the next game for the framework. Collision are one of the not solved problems in the old code, it should be possible to formalize the test and store the information in the object themself.
